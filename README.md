## Introduction

"Da Salvino" is a full-stack website for a fictional pizzeria, designed to facilitate the management of ingredients and pizzas by staff users. These items are dynamically updated on the website, allowing visitors to view the latest menu and ingredients.

Staff functionalities, including adding and managing ingredients and pizzas, are restricted to registered staff users through a hidden staff portal. Registrations require admin approval to ensure secure management access.

Intended for real-life application, the website plans to expand with features like booking, customer reviews, and favourites to enhance user engagement and operational efficiency.
